            <h1>Welcome to ShieldSquad: Who are we?  What is our Journey?</h1>
            <img src="https://shieldsquad.org/img/shield.jpg" alt="Blog">
            <p>When it came time to decide on our first blog post, one topic resonated with everyone in the group: introducing our movement, The ShieldSquad. This blog will give you an understanding of what to expect from us, our core ideas, and our future plans.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>

<p>The ShieldSquad is a collective of individuals with diverse expertise in technology. Our team includes skilled programmers, designers, and cybersecurity professionals, each with years of experience. Despite our varied backgrounds, there’s one thing that unites us all —a shared passion for cybersecurity!</p>

<h3>How We Began:</h3>

<p>Our journey started with personal projects, learning, and helping each other clear doubts in the vast field of cybersecurity. However, as cyber scams and fraud became more prevalent, especially in India, we realized that more people were falling prey to these attacks due to a lack of awareness.</p>

<p>Thus, we decided to take things to the next level and make a difference. With the increasing threat of cybercrime, the concept of cybersecurity awareness became the foundation for creating this website and launching ShieldSquad's presence on social media.</p>

<h3>Our First Project: KIRMADA</h3>

<p>We are excited to share our very first project—a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) named KIRMADA (Inspired from a fictional cartoon character on ChottaBheem). Let’s be clear: this tool is developed solely for research purposes and is used strictly within our lab environment. Stay tuned, as we will be blogging about other exciting projects in the near future.</p>

<h3>What’s Next:</h3>

<p>So, what can you expect from us? We aim to use our skills and knowledge to educate, inform, and create meaningful solutions in the realm of cybersecurity. Our blog will cover a wide array of topics—from technical deep dives to tips on how to stay safe online. We will also share our ongoing projects and how they contribute to our mission.</p>

<p>We invite you to join us on this journey. If you’re curious to learn more or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out through our contact form. Don’t forget to follow us on social media to stay updated with the latest ideas and blog posts.</p>

<p>Thank you for being part of The ShieldSquad. Together, we can make the digital world a safer place.</p>

<h3><b>Stay safe, stay secure,  </h3></b>
